                <h1><em><u>Welcome to my website style guide.</u></em></h1>
                <p id="joke"><strong>Funny:</strong> Learing to code is funny. When I started with this site, I had no action plan. I just started.
                At some point I decided that it would be easier if I coded things differently, better use of class and implementing the use of ID.
                I started changing the HTML and CSS. After several hours of hard work and redesigning my buildup, I hit that refresh page:
                <strong>and everything looked exactly the same!</strong> This was exactly what was supposed to happen and never I have been more happy with seeing no change at all,
                but knowing that in the long run this will save me tons of work. Coding can be funny. :)
                </p>
                <p>On this page you'll find my various color sets that I'll use as basis for designing my websites.
                    The sets are set up in similar order. The first color is the main background color. Second color is the color used for content boxes, while the third color is used to extra style header content.
                    The forth color is mainly used to style the fonts and borders used. Of course sometimes extra colors will be used for aditional styling or in certain cases make things more clear. 
                    Example is the white font color used in color set 1 for Dark Sienna. After all, having that as a background and a text color makes the text very, very hard to read. ;)
                </p>
                <p>I started this site as a challenge project from <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecadamy</a>.
                    As my skill progresses over time, so will this website. Most importantly it'll get more content, but also get more functionality and features.
                    One of the features implented is the ability to change the style of this website. To do so, click on the link above the color set you want to apply and watch the site change before your eyes.
                </p>
                <p>Below the color sets you'll find examples of various types of fonts. I'll use some of these fonts on my websites, while others are just there for demonstration.
                    The fonts are displayed with various text styles. It starts with plain, followed by <strong>strong</strong>, <em>Italic</em> and <u>underline</u>.
                    Below that there are examples of each header style, starting with h1 all the way to h6.
                    The text that's used is the most used text to display fonts because it has all the alphabet letters in it, acording to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Additional content might be added at a later time. This can be any kind of content that can become in handy when designing and styling websites. For example button designs and their corresponding CSS.
